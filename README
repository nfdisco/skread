skread
======

A command-line program that extracts information from databases stored
in Sk file format.  It can be used to print a summary of database
tables and to export them to SQLite format.

The Sk format is used by some electronic dictionaries, such as the
electronic version of the Longman Pronunciation Dictionary.  An
archived copy of IDM's web page — the company that developed Sk — can
be found in the link below:

** Usage

To export a large number databases under a directory tree, the
following steps are recommended:

1. Use the script skargs in combination with find to produce a list of
arguments and store them in a text file.

find dir/ -iname '*.cft' | sort | xargs ./skargs > dir.in

This file is organised in blocks, one for every database, separated
by a form-feed character.  Each block has four lines indicating

- the path to the input database
- the name of the table to be created
- a column specification
- the output file

in that order.

2. Edit the file as necessary.

3. Execute skread using the parameters from the file.

grep -v ^# dir.in | awk 'BEGIN { RS="\f" } /\S/ { print $4 "/" $2;
     system("./skread -x -t " $2 " -c \"" $3 "\" -o " $4 " " $1) }'

This may take a while, depending on the size of the databases.
